# Rt-Live-Model-Delhi
The basic code and libraries are the same as the model created by Kevin Systrom. For India, we have used state-wise testing data. Necessary changes have been made to suit Indian data in the library “data_us” from the Rt live model applied to the US testing data. The trial has been run on the data of the Delhi region starting from 9th April. 
In particular, the GenerativeModel function requires time (approximately 5 hours per each region). We are seeking support in terms of access to a server so that the model may be applied seamlessly to all the regions and we may obtain realtime results.
